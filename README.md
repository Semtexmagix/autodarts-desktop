for example the Autodarts-caller tool:
 - a tool for calling scores at Autodarts.io

the Autodarts-extern tool:
 - automates multiple dart-web-platforms accordingly to the state of an https://autodarts.io match.

you can also start extra programs:
 - like Dartsboard.Online-Client (for webcam support) or Visual Darts Zoom (VDZ)

or custom apps (like OBS to create a visual cam with custom theme)

With OBS it is possible to display the Autodarts.io game in the virtual camera.

It is also possible, to integrate a player camera with OBS into the virtual camera stream.

A full screen mode for the board.

All of this can be easily realized via OBS scenes. The scenes can be switched during the game in OBS or via hotkey.
