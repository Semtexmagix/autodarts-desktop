# AUTODARTS-DESKTOP

Autodarts-desktop manages several extension-tools for Autodarts.io.
It handles Download/setup/use of these tools.
 - Easy start of functions like caller and external transport to darts platforms as well as start of e.g. OBS - Open Brodcast System to create a visual camera.
 - Desired tools can be downloaded easily via downloader.
 - Of course the administration of all needed parameters is simplified via a setup windows; no more console starts or batch files =).

# Custom theme example:

With OBS it is possible to display the Autodarts.io game in the virtual camera.

It is also possible, to integrate a player camera with OBS into the virtual camera stream.

A full screen mode for the board.

All of this can be easily realized via OBS scenes. The scenes can be switched during the game in OBS or e.g. via hotkey.
If you use obs and start it with the custom-app function you can use "--startvirtualcam" as start argument so obs starts automatically with visual cam mode.
