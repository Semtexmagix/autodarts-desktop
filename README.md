# AUTODARTS-DESKTOP

autodarts-desktop is a tool (GUI) to manage projects of some deverlopers for the automated dartboard of Autodarts.io.
The entire management of the individual functions is handled by Autodarts-visual:
 - Easy start of functions like caller and external transport to darts portals as well as start of e.g. OBS - Open Brodcast System to create a visual camera.
 - Desired functions can be downloaded easily via downloader.
 - Of course the administration of all needed parameters for e.g. the caller is simplified via a setup menu, no more console starts or batch files =).

For example the Autodarts-caller tool:
 - The autodarts-caller is a tool that can tell you your thrown score and also the possible checkout score.

and custom programmes (like OBS - Open Brodcast System to create a visual cam with custom theme)

# Custom theme example:

With OBS it is possible to display the Autodarts.io game in the virtual camera.

It is also possible, for example, to integrate a player camera with OBS into the virtual camera stream.

A full screen mode for the board.

All this can be easily realized via OBS scenes. The scenes can be easily switched during the game in OBS or e.g. via hotkey.
If you use obs and start it with the custom app function you can enter "--startvirtualcam" as start argument so that obs goes directly into the visual cam mode at startup.
